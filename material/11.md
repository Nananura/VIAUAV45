# Chapter 11: How to use Platform-specific APIs with Platform Channels and testing Flutter Apps  
  
In the previous chapters, we've learned how we could use Flutter APIs. We also got tons of plugins that help us to provide native features.  
  
## Platform-specific APIs  
What does a native feature mean exactly? The native features are APIs that we can use in a platform-specific way. The following list contains some of the key platform-specific features:  
- using the **camera**,  
- using the **microphone**,  
- accessing location data from **GPS** and displaying it with Google Maps,  
- accessing the device's **secure storage**,  
- accessing data from the **motion sensors**,  
- accessing the **humidity sensor**,
- accessing **Bluetooth features**,  
- accessing **NFC features**,
- etc.  
  
The time may come when we would need to use at least one of the above and there may not be a plugin to support our needs.  
  
Fortunately, using the `Platform channels`, we can easily run platform native code (code written in `Objective C`, `Swift`, `Java`, or `Kotlin`).  
  
### Platform Channels  
Flutter gives us platform channels as a bridge between the client (_UI_) and host (_platform_), and we can pass events through them.  
  
The following diagram gives an overview of the Platform Channels architecture.  
   
![Architectural overview: platform channels](./images/11_platform_channels.png)  
  
As we can see in the diagram, we can send events using `MethodChannel` from Flutter to native and vice versa.  
  
> Note that sending events is an asynchronous process in Flutter's Dart side, but despite this, whenever we invoke a channel method, we must invoke that method on the platform's UI (main) thread.  
  
  
#### Type support  
The standard platform channels need a **name** and a **codec** for *serializing* / *deserializing* messages to binary form and back. The following table shows Dart platform channel types and codecs:  
![Supported types](./images/11_platform_channels_types.png)  
  
#### Sending a Method invoking from Flutter  
Firstly, we have to create our Platform Channel by passing it a unique ID, for example, a URL: 
```dart  
import 'package:flutter/services.dart'; 
 
const platformChannel = const MethodChannel('hu.bme.aut.flutter/data');  
```  
  
After that we can send a request with calling `invokeMethod()` method with passing the name of method of the native side. Unfortunately, things can go wrong so we should add try-catch block because if the communication with the platform fails for any reason, we want to be prepares to handle that error like this:  
```dart  
try {  
  final int result = await platformChannel.invokeMethod('getPlatformSpecificData');  
  _platformSpecificData = "$result in Celsius";
} on PlatformException catch (error) {  
  _platformSpecificData =  "Failed to get platform specific data: '${error.message}'."; 
}
```  
  
  
#### Running native Android code  
Start by finding the Android host portion of our Flutter application. After that open the `MainActivity.kt` located in **java** or our **kotlin** folder.

Inside the `MainActivity` we have to create and configure our `FlutterEngine`. For that we can override `configureFlutterEngine()` method of `FlutterActivity` class like this:
  ```dart  
import androidx.annotation.NonNull
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine
import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel 


class MainActivity : FlutterActivity() {

    private val CHANNEL = "hu.bme.aut.flutter/data"

    override fun configureFlutterEngine(@NonNull flutterEngine: FlutterEngine) {
        super.configureFlutterEngine(flutterEngine)
        MethodChannel(flutterEngine.dartExecutor.binaryMessenger, CHANNEL).setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->
            // Note: this method is invoked on the main thread.
            // TODO
        }
    }

}
  ``` 

> Don't forget to add the necessary imports by manually this time.  

Inside the above-mentioned `configureFlutterEngine()` method, we can create our `MethodChannel` with the same **name** that we use on the Flutter side. Next, we register a method call handler on our channel. The `MethodCallHandler` is responsible for handling several specified method calls received from Flutter. 
Previously, we specified a method with the `getPlatformSpecificData` string so in the body of `setMethodCallHandler()`'s lambda we handle it like the following code snippet:
```kotlin
MethodChannel(flutterEngine.dartExecutor.binaryMessenger, CHANNEL).setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->  
  // Note: this method is invoked on the main thread.  
  if (call.method == "getPlatformSpecificData") {  
        val currentTemp = getPlatformSpecificData()  
        if (currentTemp != null) {  
            result.success(currentTemp)  
        } else {  
            result.error("UNAVAILABLE", "Temperature level not available.", null)  
        }  
    } else {  
        result.notImplemented()  
    }  
}
```
Handler implementations must submit a `result` for all incoming `MethodCall`, by making a single call on the given `Result` callback. To achieve this, we can handle our results with the `success()` and `error()` functions. Failure to do so will result in lengthy Flutter result handlers. The result may be submitted asynchronously. Calls to unknown or unimplemented methods can be handled using `.notImplemented()` call.

> Note that If no handler has been registered, any incoming method call on this channel will be handled automatically by sending a `null` reply.

In the success case our `getPlatformSpecificData()` function provides us a valid requested `currentTemp` value. Under the hood, we have to implement the `SensorEventListener` interface for receiving new sensor data from the native `android.hardware.SensorManager` class. In the [flutter_platform_channels_basic](../projects/chapters/chapter_11/flutter_platform_channels_basic/) example, you can find a short solution for `TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE` measurement under the `sensor-specific code` `region` comments. These are the native lines of code that we don’t need to implement if we have an available flutter package.

#### Running native iOS code
Briefly, to achieve the result on the iOS side, we have to edit the `AppDelegate.swift` file in `ios/Runner`. 
>The `AppDelegate` is the core singleton that is part of the app initialization process.

First, we need to override the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` function and create a `FlutterMethodChannel` using its proper name `hu.bme.aut.flutter/data` like this:

##### [ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift]
```swift
import UIKit  
import Flutter  
  
@UIApplicationMain  
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {  
  override func application(  
    _ application: UIApplication,  
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {  
  
    let controller : FlutterViewController = window?.rootViewController as! FlutterViewController  
        let channel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: "hu.bme.aut.flutter/data",  
                                                  binaryMessenger: controller.binaryMessenger)  
        channel.setMethodCallHandler({  
          [weak self] (call: FlutterMethodCall, result: FlutterResult) -> Void in  
          // Note: this method is invoked on the UI thread.  
          guard call.method == "getPlatformSpecificData" else {  
            result(FlutterMethodNotImplemented)  
            return  
          }  
          self?.getPlatformSpecificData(result: result)  
        })  
  
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)  
    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)  
  }  
  
  private func getPlatformSpecificData(result: FlutterResult) {  
      result(30)  
    }  
}
```
#### Add Flutter to an existing mobile app
Flutter can be integrated into our **existing** native Android or iOS application, as a **library** or a **module**.
For more details on this topic, you should check the official [Integrate a Flutter module into your Android project](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app/android/project-setup) documentation.

  
## Introduction to test Flutter applications
Before diving into how we test our above-mentioned Platform channels and other projects, we'll look at the base test categories of testing with their official short terms:

- A [unit test](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing#unit-tests) tests a single function, method, or class.
- A [widget test](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing#widget-tests) (in other UI frameworks referred to as component test) tests a single widget.
- An [integration test](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing#integration-tests) tests a complete app or a large part of an ap

Why should we test anything?
Testing is an important requirement to deliver applications with the best quality. A good test code coverage can be a measure of quality for production software.

Unfortunately, in this chapter, we don’t have enough time and opportunities to convince you to write tests, follow the [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), but we'll take look at the basic tools.

### Unit tests  
Unit tests are responsible for testing separated business logic. The isolating is very important, and if we have some external dependencies of one unit we have to [mock out](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking) them. To mock dependencies, we can use the recommended [Mockito package](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito).

A unit test often falls into three sections:
- In **Arrange**, we set up everything that is going to be used by the test. 
- In the **Act**, we will call a specific function what we want to test
- In the **Assert**, we will use some type of `expect()` to make test assertions.

#### Writing the first unit test
Firstly, we have to add the [test](https://pub.dev/packages/test) package under the `dev_dependencies:` in the `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  test: ^1.17.3
```

For example, we have a complex utils like the following `quickMatch()` in a `complex_utils.dart` file in the `lib` folder:
```dart
class ComplexUtils {
  static int quickMath() {
    return 2 + 2 - 1;
  }
}
```

To test its behavior, we can create a `complex_utils_test.dart` file inside the `test` folder. The folder structure should look like this:
```
./
  lib/
    complex_utils.dart
  test/
    complex_utils_test.dart
```

> We should use the "_test" convention for ensuring readability and supporting the test runner when it searches tests.

Inside the `complex_utils_test.dart` file, by using the top-level `test()` function, we can specify our unit test. Moreover, we can check the result of `quickMatch()` function by using the top-level `expect()` function.

```dart
// Import the test package and ComplexUtils class
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app/complex_utils.dart';

void main() {
  test("Two plus two is four, minus one that's three", () {
    // Arrange
    const int expectedResult = 3;

    // Act
    final result = ComplexUtils.quickMath();

    // Assert
    expect(result, expectedResult);
  });
}
```

After that, we can run our test with the Flutter plugins of IntelliJ by clicking the green run icons or select our test in the Run/Debug Configurations or we can use the terminal to run it by executing the following command from the root of the project:
```
flutter test test/complex_utils_test.dart
```

We have several options regarding a unit test, so you should check them with the following command:
```
flutter test --help
```

#### Testing Platform Channels  
To test our added Platform Channel, we can find unit tests in the [native_datasource_test.dart](../projects/chapters/chapter_11/flutter_platform_channels/test/data/native/native_datasource_test.dart) file of the [flutter_platform_channels](../projects/chapters/chapter_11/flutter_platform_channels/) project.
As we see, our Platform Channel can act as a native data source if we build our app using architectural layers.
##### [./test/data/native/native_datasource_test.dart]

```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'package:flutter_platform_channels/data/native/channel.dart';
import 'package:flutter_platform_channels/data/native/native_datasource.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';

import '../../di/di_test_utils.dart';

void main() {
  NativeDataSource nativeDataSource;
  MethodChannel methodChannel;

  setUp(() {
    methodChannel = MethodChannelMock();
    nativeDataSource = NativeDataSourceImpl(methodChannel: methodChannel);
  });
  
  //...
}
```
In the code snippet above, we import mocked dependencies from our [di_test_utils.dart](../projects/chapters/chapter_11/flutter_platform_channels/test/di/di_test_utils.dart) file, where we mock our MethodChannel like this:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';

class MethodChannelMock extends Mock implements MethodChannel {}
```
Back to the `native_datasource_test.dart`, we use the `setUp()` function to initialize those objects what we want to share between tests. The `setUp()` callback will run before every test suite. There’s another useful function the `tearDown()`, which will run after every test, even if a test fails. We use it for testing BloCs.

We can wrap tests using the `group()` function, which gives us the possibility to group semantically different unit tests. For this reason, inside the `getTemperature()` group we create a group of tests for **happy scenarios** and one group for **error scenarios**.

In the following happy scenarios tests, we will use the `when()` function provided by Mockito to return always with the same stubbed value as the response when our `nativeDataSource` will use via its `getTemperature()` function.
```dart
//...
  group('getTemperature()', () {
    group('happy scenarios', () {
      test(
          'Get the temperature from the method channel successfully with a positive value',
          () async {
        // Arrange
        const int expectedResult = 10;
        when(methodChannel.invokeMethod(Channel.getTemp))
            .thenAnswer((_) async => expectedResult);

        // Act
        final result = await nativeDataSource.getTemperature();

        // Assert
        expect(result, expectedResult);
      });

      test(
          'Get the temperature from the method channel successfully with a negative value',
          () async {
        // Arrange
        const int expectedResult = -10;
        when(methodChannel.invokeMethod(Channel.getTemp))
            .thenAnswer((_) async => expectedResult);

        // Act
        final result = await nativeDataSource.getTemperature();

        // Assert
        expect(result, expectedResult);
      });
    });
//...
```
The official name of this mechanism is stubbing. Mockito provides us `when`, `thenReturn`, `thenAnswer`, and `thenThrow` APIs to override different method invocations. We use the `thenAnswer` to return `Future`, and we can write asynchronous tests if we use the `async`/  `await` properly.
```dart
//...
    group('error scenarios', () {
      test(
          'return data error when native fails to return temperature and it returns with null',
          () async {
        // Arrange
        const int response = null;
        const String expectedError = 'temp is missing';
        when(methodChannel.invokeMethod(Channel.getTemp))
            .thenAnswer((_) async => response);

        // Act
        // Assert
        expect(
          () => nativeDataSource.getTemperature(),
          throwsA(
            predicate(
                (e) => e is PlatformException && e.message == expectedError),
          ),
        );
      });

      test(
          'return data error when native fails to return temperature and it throws PlatformException',
          () async {
        // Arrange
        const String expectedError = 'temp is missing';
        when(methodChannel.invokeMethod(Channel.getTemp))
            .thenThrow(PlatformException(message: expectedError, code: ""));

        // Act
        // Assert
        expect(
          () => nativeDataSource.getTemperature(),
          throwsA(
            predicate(
                (e) => e is PlatformException && e.message == expectedError),
          ),
        );
      });

      test(
          'return data error when native fails to return temperature and it throws a default exception',
          () async {
        // Arrange
        const String expectedError = 'temp is missing';
        when(methodChannel.invokeMethod(Channel.getTemp))
            .thenThrow(MissingPluginException());

        // Act
        // Assert
        expect(
          () => nativeDataSource.getTemperature(),
          throwsA(
            predicate(
                (e) => e is PlatformException && e.message == expectedError),
          ),
        );
      });
    });
//...
```
In the tests of error scenarios above, we use `thenThrow()` function for stubbing our methodChannel invoking to throw different exceptions.
In this example, we've learned how to use Mockito to test each condition of our Platform Channel.

#### Testing BloCs  
Let's see our `HomeBloc` in the [home_bloc.dart](../projects/chapters/chapter_11/flutter_platform_channels/lib/ui/home/bloc/home_bloc.dart) file of the [flutter_platform_channels](../projects/chapters/chapter_11/flutter_platform_channels/) project:

```dart
class HomeBloc extends Bloc<HomeEvent, HomeState> {
  HomeBloc({
    @required this.repository,
  }) : super(HomeStateLoading());
  final Repository repository;

  @override
  Stream<HomeState> mapEventToState(HomeEvent event) async* {
    if (event is HomeEventGetTemperature) {
      yield HomeStateLoading();
      yield await _mapLoadTemperatureToState();
    }
  }

  Future<HomeState> _mapLoadTemperatureToState() async {
    try {
      final int result = await repository.getTemperature();
      return HomeStateLoaded(temperature: result);
    } catch (e) {
      return HomeStateError();
    }
  }
}
```

To test `HomeBloc`, we define groups for happy and error cases, and using `setUp()` we create our `bloc` for all tests and with `tearDown()` we close it when all tests are completed.

##### [./test/ui/home/bloc/home_bloc_test.dart]
```dart
void main() {
  HomeBloc bloc;
  Repository mockRepository;

  setUp(() {
    mockRepository = RepositoryMock();

    bloc = HomeBloc(repository: mockRepository);
  });

  tearDown(() {
    bloc.close();
  });

  group("Happy Cases", () {
    test('when screen started', () {
      // Assert
      expect(
        bloc.state,
        equals(
          HomeStateLoading(),
        ),
      );
    });

    test('when temperature fetching starts and it loads with success', () {
      // Arrange
      final int expectedResult = 10;
      when(mockRepository.getTemperature())
          .thenAnswer((_) async => expectedResult);

      // Act
      bloc.add((HomeEventGetTemperature()));

      // Assert
      expectLater(
        bloc,
        emitsInOrder(
          [
            HomeStateLoading(),
            HomeStateLoaded(temperature: expectedResult),
          ],
        ),
      );
    });
  });

  group("Error Cases", () {
    test("when temperature fetching starts but it fails", () {
      // Arrange
      when(mockRepository.getTemperature())
          .thenThrow(MissingPluginException('message'));

      // Act
      bloc.add((HomeEventGetTemperature()));

      // Assert
      expectLater(
        bloc,
        emitsInOrder(
          [
            HomeStateLoading(),
            HomeStateError(),
          ],
        ),
      );
    });
  });
}

```
Thanks to the description of the tests, it is quite clear which state handling, functionalities of the current bloc can be easily tested.
  
### Widget tests  
In the section of Unit testing, we learned how to test Dart classes using the test package. 

To test widgets, we need to add the [flutter_test](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html) library under the `dev_dependencies:` in the `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

In our Flutter project test folder we create a simple `widget_test.dart` with the following code:
```dart
void main() {

testWidgets('MyHomePage has a title', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());

    // Verifications.
    expect(find.text("Flutter Platform Channels demo - updated"), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing);
  });
}
```

As we see, the main difference from the Unit test that we need to use the` WidgetTester` tool, which allows building and interacting with widgets in our test environment. To create `WidgetTester`, we have to use `testWidgets()` function instead of normal `test()` function.

Inside our first widget test, we use the `pumpWidget()` method provided by the `WidgetTester` to build and render our `MyApp` widget. The `pumpWidget` method creates a `MyApp` instance that displays a "_Flutter Platform Channels demo - updated_" text as the title of its `AppBar`. To search through the widget tree for that title, we can use the [Finder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/Finder-class.html) class.
Ensure that our title appears on the screen exactly one time. For this purpose, we can use the `findsOneWidget` [Matcher](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/package-matcher_matcher/Matcher-class.html).

There are more matchers and finders for common cases and also it is possible to test different user interactions like:
- [entering text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester/enterText.html),
- [tapping](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetController/tap.html),
- [dragging](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetController/drag.html).

For more information on how to write more tests, especially **integration tests**, which we can’t cover in this chapter, see the following materials and further reading.
